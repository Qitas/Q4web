重生!
=============

“我居然渴望他们爱我，我真可怜。”

                  —— 提利昂·兰尼斯特


philosophy
=============

你要知道什么是自己想要的，知道什么是不可逆转的，知道用什么方式实现梦想，知道用什么心情面对苦难，人就在转瞬间感悟，进退得失不离不弃也就都有了答案。我不知道命运会把我带到何方，但是我一直会用善良维护左右

We used the following format:

* Before the offsite, we created a Trello board with a list of topics to discuss. This was all the major feature ideas, issues, and concerns that came up over the previous couple months.
* For the first 3 days, we went through the list and discussed each topic. We took notes (almost 20 pages) of these discussions, and mostly tried to build a shared understanding on a path forward.
* The 4th day we broke each section down into action items, and chunked them into 1-3 smaller sections of work. We called these "v1", "v2", and "v3" to break out the stages where each project could be shipped and have impact on our users.
* The 5th day we took all the tasks, then sized and prioritized them. We broke things out into 4 piles representing months going forward, and tried to balance the tasks so each month had a similar amount of work in it. We then turned this into a Trello roadmap board.

This worked quite well for us.
It gave us space to talk through all the various topics we had,
but also gave concrete next steps to move forward on our tasks.

lifestyle
=============

The most valuable outcome is something I said at the offsite:

    Before, it felt like we were 5 contributors working on an open source project. Now, it feels like we're members of a team.

For each member of the team,
there was someone else they had never met in person before this.
Having all met in person will make it much easier to collaborate online going foward,
and to feel like we are working towards a goal that we all share.

"再遇到喜欢的人，想来只觉得非常遗憾，早几年遇见就好了，那些热烈、欢喜、年少轻狂和桀骜不驯，连同整个世界都要送给你。可你来得太晚了，我已经学会了一个人送走落日，一个人等待星光，我的爱早在无数个孤立无援的时刻里，变得有了计较和盘算，再也没有曾经的纯粹"
