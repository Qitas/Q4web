Thanks for your interest in working at Read the Docs.
We are a small team of 5, and we're looking to add 2-3 people in 2021,
and we'd love for you to be one of them.

About the company
-----------------

Read the Docs is a large `open source project <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org>`_ providing documentation building and hosting.
You can think of it a continuous integration for docs.
We do around :doc:`500 million pageviews </read-the-docs-2019-stats>` each year.
We are a small team,
but **this role will have a large impact of millions of users.**
Our codebase is almost entirely open source,
and we feel strongly about supporting the community while sustaining the project in an ethical manner.

We have two primary products:

* A free hosting service for open source projects, funded via ethical ads: https://readthedocs.org
* A paid hosting service for companies, funded via subscriptions: https://readthedocs.com

This role would primarily be working on the core Read the Docs codebase and extensions to Read the Docs that we maintain.
