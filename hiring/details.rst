Additional Responsibilities
---------------------------

All of our team members are responsible for some of the basic operations of the project.
As a small team,
there are a lot of jobs to be done and not many hands to fill them.
You will be responsible for owning projects in your area of the team,
but also working on many other things.

User support is one of the main things you will be handling that spans the business.
We have GitHub issues and emails that come in each day,
and we have a support rotation for dealing with them.
You can expect being primarily responsible for handling support one day a week,
along with following up with users each day as necessary.

Requirements
------------

We want someone with experience and vision to improve the product as a whole,
and can contribute across multiple domains.
We are a small team and you will be given a lot autonomy in building and improving things,
so being self-driven is an asset.

Being familiar with some or most of the tools `listed above <#technical-details>`_ would be great,
however we believe experience with similar tools should translate easily as well.
Having some knowledge of the data science community is also useful,
given the grant work that will be part of this role.
**We realize that you might not know all of our tools,
please reach out if you think you'd be a good fit.**

We are a fully remote company and our team is currently based in the US, South America, and in Europe.
We hope to work with people that are based in timezone where we have some overlap with the entire team,
which is around UTC-8 to UTC+1.


Structure
---------

We are currently only able to offer contracts to work on the project.
**The plan would be for us to contract with you to work between 3-5 days a week.**
Half of our team works 4 days, and the other half works 5 days,
and we are happy to be flexible with whatever works best for you.

After an initial interview,
we normally do a small paid project to see how we work together.
If that goes well,
we will move towards a longer term contract.
We plan for this role to continue after 2021,
working on Read the Docs fully after the grant funding expires.

The pay rate will vary with experience and the number of days worked.
As a small, self-sustaining open source project we are not able to pay as much as large companies.
We are able to provide a supportive and very flexible work environment,
with a strong sense of mission.
All of the members of our team have worked with us for more than 2 years,
and we strive to have a stable team working to build something meaningful.
